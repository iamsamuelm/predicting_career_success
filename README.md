## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Career success is influenced by multiple factors, including academic performance, skills, and networking. However, students and job seekers often struggle to identify which aspects of their education and career development will have the greatest impact on their future success. 

This project uses predictive analytics to explore how academic performance, internships, projects, and networking contribute to career success. Using a dataset of 5,000 student recordsâ€”including university ranking, GPA, skills, and career outcomesâ€”we develop models to predict:

- ðŸŽ¯ Career Satisfaction
- ðŸ’¼ Number of Job Offers
- ðŸ’° Starting Salary

The results offer actionable insights to help students, career advisors, and educators optimize educational and career development strategies.
